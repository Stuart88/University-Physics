# University-Physics
A library for performing advanced physics calculations.

See https://github.com/Stuart88/University-Physics/tree/master/University%20Physics for University Physics library and documentation. 

All contributions to University Physics must have working unit tests. 

A new unit test class can be created if the current classes are not suitable.
